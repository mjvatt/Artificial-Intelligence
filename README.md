# Artificial-Intelligence

## This repo is to answer issues, questions, data set topics, and explore learning new techniques within AI

First, these are from a certficate course I took from Columbia University about AI: 

- Search Algorithms 
- Adversarial Search and Games 
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems 
- Natural Language Processing 

In the future, I hope to add more of my own AI side projects.
